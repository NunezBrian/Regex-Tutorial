# Comprehensive Guide to Regular Expressions (Regex)

Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. They are used in various programming languages for searching, validating, and manipulating text. This tutorial will provide a detailed explanation of the components of regex and how they work together.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we will explore the essential components of regular expressions, including anchors, quantifiers, the OR operator, character classes, flags, grouping and capturing, bracket expressions, greedy and lazy matches, boundaries, back-references, and look-ahead and look-behind assertions. Here is a sample regex we will break down: `/^(\w+)\s+(\d{1,2}),\s+(\d{4})$/`.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

Anchors are used to specify the position in the string where a match must occur. The two main anchors are `^` (start of the string) and `$` (end of the string).

### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify how many times a character or a group should be matched. Common quantifiers include `*` (0 or more), `+` (1 or more), `?` (0 or 1), and `{n,m}` (between n and m times).

### OR Operator

The OR operator `|` allows for matching one pattern or another. For example, `a|b` matches either `a` or `b`.

### Character Classes

Character classes allow for matching any one of several characters. They are defined using square brackets, such as `[abc]` to match `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Flags

Flags modify the behavior of the regex. Common flags include `i` (case insensitive), `g` (global match), and `m` (multiline).

### Grouping and Capturing

Parentheses `()` are used for grouping parts of the regex together and capturing matched text for use later. For example, `(\w+)` captures one or more word characters.

### Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions `[ ]` match any single character contained within the brackets. They can include ranges, such as `[a-z]` to match any lowercase letter.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy matches (`*`, `+`, `{n,m}`) try to match as much text as possible, while lazy matches (`*?`, `+?`, `{n,m}?`) try to match as little text as possible.

### Boundaries

Word boundaries `\b` match the position between a word character and a non-word character. For example, `\bword\b` matches the word "word" but not "sword" or "words".

### Back-references

Back-references allow for referring to previously captured groups in the same regex. For example, `(\w+)\s+\1` matches a repeated word separated by whitespace.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Look-ahead `(?=...)` and look-behind `(?<=...)` assertions specify a match that is followed or preceded by another pattern, without including that pattern in the match.
